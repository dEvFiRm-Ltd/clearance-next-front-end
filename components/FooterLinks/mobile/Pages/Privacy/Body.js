          <strong>Do we use 'cookies'?</strong>

          Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider

          you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to
          recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
          For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items
          in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your
          preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables
          us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help
          us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so
          that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

          <strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
          <br />
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
          law in the UK and the concepts they include have played a significant
          role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
          Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
          should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy
          laws that protect personal information.
          <br />
          <strong>
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
            the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          </strong>
          <br />
          We will notify the users via email
          <br />• Within 7 business days
          <br />
          We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that
          individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against
          data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
          principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
          against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts
          or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance
          by data processors.
