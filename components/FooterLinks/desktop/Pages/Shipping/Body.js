          Our estimated delivery dates are based on several factors, including
          the destination address, the shipping options you've chosen, and how
          quickly we can assemble and prepare your items for shipment. You can
          calculate delivery estimates by taking the processing time for your
          order and adding the delivery time based on the shipping method you've
          chosen.
        </p>
        <p className="p">
          For example, if you order a bodycon dress, it will need 3-5 business
          days of processing time and then 10-15 business days of shipping time
          if you select standard shipping. Therefore, you can expect to receive
          it in 13-20 business days. And you can expect to receive it in 8-15
          business days if you select expedited shipping (5-10 business days).
