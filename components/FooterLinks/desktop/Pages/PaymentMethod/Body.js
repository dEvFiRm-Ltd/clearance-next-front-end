          Please note that stylewe.com does not collect your credit/debit card
          number or personal information when you make a payment. We also take
          fraud very seriously too, so all credit and debit card holders are
          subject to validation and authorisation by both us and the card
          issuer. To better protect our customers when making online payments by
          card you may be presented with 3D secure security measures when
          paying. This is dependent on your bank issuer and may require you to
          enter a password or get a security code via email or phone, or the
          bank issuer requires additional interaction, either through
          fingerprint, two-factor authentication, or similar methods based on
          authentication factors. For more questions regarding the
          authentication, please consult your card-issuing bank for information.

        <p className="MsoNormal">
          If your payment has been declined, then you'll need to place your
          order again. We're not able to reinstate an order once the payment has
          been declined.

        <p className="MsoNormal">
          <strong>2. Make the relevant checks</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="MsoNormal">
          To help ensure your order is not declined when placing a new order we
          suggest checking the following:
        </p>
        <p className="MsoNormal">
          Check the card details on your to make sure the information is
          correct, e.g. the expiry date .

        <p className="MsoNormal">
          Make sure you enter the security code correctly - that's the three
          digit number on the back of your card.
        </p>
        <p className="MsoNormal">
          Your card issuer may have declined your payment - as they don't tell
          us the reason for this, it's best to check with them or contact your
          bank.
        </p>
        <p className="MsoNormal">
          If you've checked all of the above, try paying with another card or
          another payment method.

          <strong>3. Next steps</strong>

          If your payment has been declined through the 3D secure security
          measures you’ll need to contact your bank for further information.

          <strong>Pay with PayPal</strong>

        <p className="MsoNormal">
          PayPal is an easy way to integrate today’s most popular payment
          methods. And PayPal makes it simple to add new payment methods
          whenever they become available.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="MsoNormal">
          Firstly, you can set up a Paypal account on the PayPal website. It
          only takes minutes to open a PayPal account and it’s free. And then
          when pay with Paypal, you will be redirected to the PayPal payment

        </p>
        <p className="MsoNormal">
          <br />
          <strong>Why pay with PayPal?</strong>
